This entails creating all nodes at level n+1 by dividing all nodes eligible for splitting at level n.

Level 1 has been subdivided into three nodes, identified as \"Node_2_1,\" \"Node_2_2,\" and \"Node_2_3,\" signifying the first, second, and third nodes of the second level of splitting. Please adhere to this notation for naming each node.\n","\n","* Imagine a dictionary named \"dataframe_dict,\" where the \"keys\" correspond to the node names at a specific splitting level, and the \"values\" represent the associated dataframes. To illustrate, for level 1, the \"dataframe_dict\" would consist of a single key, \"Node_1_1,\" with the corresponding value being the primary dataframe:\n","                dataframe_dict = {\"Node_1_1\": the main dataframe}\n","In this example, following the execution of the \"data_split\" function, the \"dataframe_dict\" dictionary should be replaced with a dictionary containing three entries, as demonstrated below:\n","      dataframe_dict = {\n","                            \"Node_2_1\": dataframe_2_1,\n","                            \"Node_2_2\": dataframe_2_2,\n","                            \"Node_2_3\": dataframe_2_3\n","                        }\n","\n","\n","\n","* Similarly, consider another dictionary called \"remaining_attrs\" with \"keys\" representing the nodes' names, and \"values\" representing the splittable attributes for each node.

The function must also retun a boolean flag \"stop_train\" which must be True if any child node is generated. Otherwise, it must return False.

Decision Tree\n","\n","(Q.6., **10 Marks**): Now, let's create a function called \"tree_train\" to train the decision tree. This function begins by initializing the tree model and dataframe dictionary using the root node named \"node_1_1.\" It then iteratively updates these structures as it progresses through the tree, continuing until no further child nodes are generated. The process starts at level 1, and with each iteration, the level is incremented. Importantly, make sure to utilize the \"split_data\" function, which you've previously implemented, to assist in the tree construction. Ultimately, the function must return the fully trained tree model.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"1EVuxiv2zD8c"},"outputs":[],"source":["def
