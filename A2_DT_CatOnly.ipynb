The function must also retun a boolean flag \"stop_train\" which must be True if any child node is generated. Otherwise, it must return False.

Part 8: Evaluating the Model\n","\n","* (Q.8-a, **5 Marks**)In the final step of this assignment, you'll apply the decision tree learning process. Start by training the decision tree on the training dataset using the 'tree_train' function, setting the terminating threshold to 0.9. Next, employ the 'tree_prediction' function, as previously implemented, to generate predictions for both the training and testing datasets. Following this, your task is to compare these predicted labels with the actual ground-truth labels to compute and report the accuracy rates for both the training and testing datasets.\n","\n","* (Q.8-b, **5 Marks**) Now, repeat the process with a different terminating threshold, specifically 0.7, and once again calculate and report the accuracy rates for the training and testing datasets. Finally, compare and contrast the results obtained with the two different threshold values (0.9 and 0.7). Provide an analysis and discussion of why one threshold might yield higher accuracy compared to the other."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"D9Jt2EBp6uuU"},"outputs":[],"source":["#.................................\n","# write the rest here:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMseztk+f92ev7YF44ZdQiz","provenance":[{"file_id":"19CmDcPf84La1mTvE0Gi0VE-ILrGARQt8","timestamp":1695758816173},{"file_id":"1_0_f28q3RsHEbCI9TXMfcytOE-A_8xU7","timestamp":1695591943950}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
